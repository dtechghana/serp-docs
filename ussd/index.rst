USSD Bill Payment
#################

sERP's USSD bill payment platform simplifies school fees collection by enabling parents/guardians pay for their wards' bills via mobile money across all supported networks in Ghana. Payments are reconciled in real-time, and confirmation will be sent out to parents via SMS (if enabled).

The USSD bill payment platform is offered in partnership with Ghanaian Fintech and payment service provider `Emergent Payments <http://emergentafrica.com/>`_ , and is available via ***789*87#** on all networks in Ghana.

To avail of this solution, your school would need to be profiled and onboarded onto the `Interpay <https://www.interpayafrica.com/>`_ payment gateway operated by Emergent Payments, after which a unique code will be generated for your school for use on the platform. Your school's unique code can be found within your `sERP settings <https://docs.schoolerpghana.com/en/main/settings/index.html>`_.
